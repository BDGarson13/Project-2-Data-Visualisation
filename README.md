# data_visualisation_practice_projects

- Having gone through the majority of the theory section of *Python Crash Course*, it is time for me to embark on projects!
- While many different iterations of each project were made, the three categories were:
  - Plotted quadratic and cubic functions
  - Simulated random walks, applying it to real life cases, e.g. path taken by a molecule
  - Simulated dice throws of varying and analysed their results distributions
